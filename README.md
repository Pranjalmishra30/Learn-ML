# Learn-ML
Common Machine learning algorithms implemented in python from **scratch** and by using **libraries**.  

## Index  
1. [Scratch](Scratch/): ML algorithms implemented by using basic python. Great to build fundamentals.  

2. [Libraries](Libraries/): ML algorithms implemeted by using sophisticated libraries. Great to build efficient and accurate models that are ready to deploy.  

## Projects  
After learning the basic implementation, it is always great to apply our learning to real life problems. Hence we will build projects that solidify our concepts and understand the application of ML.

## Machine Learning libraries  
* [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)  
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Future Scope  
1. Add more algorithms implemented from scratch.  
2. Add examples for tensorflow and pytorch implementations
